# Stevens Creek Chevrolet Voice Assistant

A real-time streaming voice assistant for Stevens Creek Chevrolet dealership built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), FastAPI, and WebSockets.

## Overview

This application demonstrates a conversational AI assistant that can handle both text and audio interactions. The assistant, named "Stevy", provides information about vehicle sales specials, service offers, EV incentives, and vehicle inventory by scraping real-time data from the dealership's website.

## Features

- **Real-time Streaming**: Supports both text and audio modalities for natural conversation
- **WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional real-time communication between client and server
- **Tool Integration**: Uses custom tools to fetch live data from stevenscreekchevy.com
- **Audio Processing**: Records and plays back audio using Web Audio API
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation context per user session
